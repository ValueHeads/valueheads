        <p class="mb-2">
          I started ValueHeads as a project to share with my friends and family
          the tools and mindset required to succeed as entrepreneurs, inspired
          by the lessons I learned from 14 years since creating and running
          Tweepi from 2009 till 2023. It was a Twitter marketing app that had
          2M+ users, btw.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          I'd like to wrap things up with these three main lessons:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            It's all about <strong>connecting with people</strong>. You need to
            talk to as many potential customers and experts in your chosen niche
            as possible, relate to them, and understand their day-to-day
            processes in doing what they do. That's how solutions to real-world
            problems are uncovered.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing comes first</strong>. You can assemble the best
            team, build the most perfect product, and still make $0 if there is
            no market. That's product/market fit. So "build in public" and
            create content in your niche.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stick to your niche. Build reputation.</strong> Otherwise,
            with every new idea you try, you'll be back to square one rather
            than building on top of your previous work. You don't need to
            already have that reputation to start; just summarizing your
            learnings and meeting more people in the niche will help you get
            there.
          </li>
        </ol>
