        <p class="mb-2">
          ValueHeads started as a project to teach my friends and family about
          the tools and mindset they need to succeed as entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Lessons learned can be summarized into three big ones:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            It's all about <strong>connecting with people</strong>. You need to
            talk to as many potential customers and experts in your chosen niche
            as possible, relate to them, and understand their day-to-day
            processes in doing what they do. That's how solutions to real-world
            problems are uncovered.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing comes first</strong>. You can assemble the best
            team, build the most perfect product, and still make $0 if there is
            no market. That's product/market fit. So "build in public" and
            create content in your niche.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stick to your niche. Build reputation.</strong> Otherwise,
            with every new idea you try, you'll be back to square one rather
            than building on top of your previous work. You don't need to
            already have that reputation to start; just summarizing your
            learnings and meeting more people in the niche will help you get
            there.
          </li>
        </ol>

          I am no longer developing ValueHeads because I realized that mentoring
          entrepreneurs is more like therapy than a scalable course. For that, I
          recommend

            >listening to Brian Scordato's "Idea to Startup" podcast</a
