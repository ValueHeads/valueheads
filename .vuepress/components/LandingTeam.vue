              I'm Amer. Founder of ValueHeads.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              I'm an entrepreneur and software engineer, building businesses for
              the last 12+ years.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              More than 2 million users used Tweepi.com to grow their Twitter
              audiences. That's my business since 2009.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I've been
              <strong>coaching "Value Entrepreneurship"</strong> and developing
              this course with 5 amazing mentees for the past few years, and the
              outcomes have been incredible.
              <strong class="text-yellow"
                >All have made money or have a tested idea that will soon make
                them money</strong
              >.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              <strong>This course's techniques are far too powerful</strong> to
              be limited to the realm of one-on-one mentorship. That's why
              <strong class="text-yellow">it's free and open</strong>, in a way
              that can help thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs rather than just
              the few I can personally mentor.
